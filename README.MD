# Vertical Filter Bar

## Overview
The Vertical Filter Bar component shall be used to consolidate and display a collection of all filters which collectively can be used by end users to specify parameter boundaries for a given data set rendered on screen.

## Using Vertical Filter Bar

The Vertical Filter Bar can be included as follows:

```
import VerticalFilterBar from '../vertical-filter-bar/VerticalFilterBar.jsx';

...

filterValueChange(newFilterValue) {
  [do some logic here]
}

...

<VerticalFilterBar
 filtersConfig={filterConfigStructureJsonObj}
 filterValues={this.state.filterValues}
 onFilterChange={this.filterValueChange}
 filterTitle={SOME_TITLE_TO_DISPLAY_ABOVE_FILTER}
/>
```

The Vertical Filter Bar can be configured by passing a well formatted JSON object to the filtersConfig property

Current state of the filters can be maintained through the filterValues property

When a filter is changed, the onFilterChange property will be called and passed the values for all filters

The filter bar can optionally have a title set above it via the filterTitle property

## Run & Test Locally
The Vertical Filter Bar component can be launched independently in order to see/test it's capabilities as follows:

1. type the following NPM command from a comand prompt that supports NPM: npm run startDev
3. view the test app at the following URL: http://localhost:8006/vertical-filter-bar/

Once launched, the Vertical Filter Bar will be displayed on the side of the page with a set of demo filters preconfigured. The centre of the page shall list the filter names and their currenlty set/selected values.

Changing a filter value in the Vertical Filter Bar shall update its corresponding displayed value in the main (central) portion of the screen.
